# Introduction

Welcome to the Football Coaching Mobile App repository! This app is built using React Native and provides features that are beneficial for football coaching.

### What's Inside

##### Components

Components are reusable parts of the app that make up the user interface (UI). Think of them as building blocks. Here's what I've created:

Box: The Box is a versatile container used in the UI to group other elements together. . It can hold and organize texts, images, or other components,ensuring a clean and organized layout.

Button: Buttons are interactive elements that users can tap or click. They perform specific actions within the app, like submitting a form or navigating to another screen.

Label: Labels are text elements that provide clear names or descriptions for UI elements. They're especially important for form inputs, ensuring users know what information is expected.

Profile Page: The Profile Page is a dedicated section where users can view and edit their personal information. It includes details like name, profile picture, and other relevant data.

Recording Button: This is a special button that lets users start or pause audio or video recordings. Its state changes to reflect whether a recording is in progress or not.
